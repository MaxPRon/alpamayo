# Dependencies from pyproject.toml
# Note: torch and torchvision are excluded as they're pre-installed in Docker containers
# Note: numpy, pandas, pyarrow versions are constrained by pre-installed packages in NVIDIA container

# Constrain numpy and pyarrow to prevent conflicts with pre-installed packages
# Pre-installed packages require: numpy<2.0.0 (torch-tensorrt), numpy<2.3 (cupy), numpy<1.27 (numba), pyarrow<20.0.0 (cudf)
numpy<1.27,>=1.22  # Constrain to satisfy all pre-installed packages
pyarrow<20.0.0,>=14.0.0  # Constrain to satisfy cudf requirements

# Core dependencies
accelerate>=1.12.0
av>=16.0.1
einops>=0.8.1
hydra-colorlog>=1.2.0
hydra-core>=1.3.2
# pandas>=2.3.3  # Commented out - conflicts with cudf (needs <2.2.4), will use pre-installed version
# physical_ai_av>=0.1.0  # Install separately with --no-deps to bypass numpy>=2.0.0 requirement
pillow>=12.0.0
transformers==4.57.1
# Resolve conflict: physical-ai-av needs >=0.36.0, transformers needs <1.0 and >=0.34.0
huggingface-hub>=0.36.0,<1.0
# physical_ai_av dependencies (installed separately because physical_ai_av uses --no-deps)
scipy>=1.14.0  # Required for scipy.spatial.transform.RigidTransform (added in scipy 1.14.0)
